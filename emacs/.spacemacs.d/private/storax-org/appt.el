;;
;;    Notification of today's appointments from your diary file.
;;
;; Note: This code is quite old, and is likely obsolete now.  You
;;       might find it useful in some way to mine - or not. ;-)
;;
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is an "enhanced" version of `appt.el' with modifications by
;; Drew Adams.  The original code was written by Neil Mager
;; <neilm@juliet.ll.mit.edu>.  See description of differences from the
;; original GNU (Mager) version, below.
;;
;; Visible and/or audible notification of today's appointments from
;; your diary file (variable `diary-file' (see file `calendar+.el').
;;
;; Reminder messages may optionally be displayed in the mode line, in
;; the message area, or in a separate buffer.
;;
;; Variable `appt-message-warning-time' determines how much notice is
;; given before each appointment reminder.  Variable `appt-checking-p'
;; specifies whether or not to notify you of pending appointments.
;;
;; In order to use this, you need to have a `diary-file' and invoke
;; `calendar'.  The following should be in your `~/.emacs':
;;
;; (setq appt-checking-p t)
;; (add-hook 'diary-hook 'appt-make-list)
;;
;;  This is an example of two reminders in your `diary-file':
;; Monday
;;   9:30am Coffee break
;;  12:00pm Lunch        
;; 
;; With the above lines in files `~/.emacs' and `diary-file', the
;; calendar and diary are displayed when you enter invoke `calendar',
;; and your appointments list is automatically be created.  You are
;; reminded before 9:30am about your coffee break and before noon to
;; go to lunch.
;;
;; This appointments reminder facility works with a copy of today's
;; appointments, gleaned from your diary (`diary-file').  It generally
;; does not change the diary itself.  This copy, the appointments
;; list, is called `appt-time-msg-list', and it is updated each time
;; `appt-make-list' is called.  This is normally whenever the function
;; `diary' is called (via `list-diary-entries', via `diary-hook').

;; The function `appt-check' checks `appt-time-msg-list' periodically,
;; and notifies you of upcoming appointments.
;;
;; You can add or delete appointment reminders from today's list with
;; `appt-add' and `appt-delete'.  Such additions are normally *not*
;; additions to the diary itself, but only to `appt-time-msg-list'.
;; They concern today only, and they are *volatile*: they do not
;; persist beyond your Emacs session.  Likewise, such deletions are
;; *not* deletions from the diary itself (even if the diary was the
;; source of the appointment for `appt-time-msg-list').
;;
;; An exception to this is the following: If you give a prefix
;; argument to `appt-add', it will also add an entry to your diary for
;; the appointment.  If the prefix is negative, the new diary entry is
;; non-marking; otherwise, it is marking.
;;
;; The appointments list is recreated automatically at 12:01am (by a
;; call to function `diary'), if Emacs is running at that time.
;;
;; If you change your diary file, the changes will not be taken into
;; account by this reminder facility, unless you reexecute the
;; function `diary' (`appt-make-list').  Remember, however, that
;; reexecuting `diary' will reinitialize `appt-time-msg-list', wiping
;; out any volatile changes you may have made via `appt-add' and
;; `appt-delete'.
;;
;; You can change the way the appointment reminders window is created
;; and deleted by setting the variables `appt-disp-window-function'
;; and `appt-delete-window-function'.  For instance, these can be set
;; to functions that display appointments in pop-up frames, which are
;; lowered or iconified after `appt-display-interval' seconds.
;;
;;
;; Main changes here from the original GNU version (Mager's):
;; ---------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. Added functions:
;;    `appt', `appt-delete-past-appts', `appt-hide-reminders',
;;    `appt-insert-anniversary-diary-entry',
;;    `appt-insert-cyclic-diary-entry', `appt-insert-diary-entry',
;;    `appt-insert-monthly-diary-entry',
;;    `appt-insert-weekly-diary-entry',
;;    `appt-insert-yearly-diary-entry', `appt-remind',
;;    `appt-remove-past-appts', `clear-appointments',
;;    `minutes-past-midnight', `reminders-mode', `save-reminders',
;;    `show-reminders', `show-reminders-reminder'.
;; 2. Removed functions:
;;    `appt-disp-window', `appt-delete-window',
;;    `appt-select-lowest-window' (called only by `appt-disp-window').
;; 3. Variable renamings: `appt-issue-message' -> `appt-checking-p',
;;    `appt-message-warning-time' -> `appt-msg-warning-time'.
;; 4. Added variables:
;;    `appt-time+msg-regexp', `reminders-mode-map',
;;    `view-appointments-initially'.
;; 5. Removed variable `appt-issue-message'.
;; 6. Variable `appt-disp-window-function' has default value
;;    `appt-remind' (not `appt-disp-window').  Variable
;;    `appt-delete-window-function' has default value
;;    `appt-hide-reminders'(not `appt-delete-window').
;; 7. More flexibility in input time expressions
;;    (`appt-time+msg-regexp').
;; 8. `appt-check':  
;;    a. Remove past appointments first, even if not `appt-checking-p'.
;;    b. Call `appt-delete-window-function' only if
;;       `appt-display-duration' is a number.
;;    c. Don't remove message when `min-to-app' = 0.
;;    d. Show reminders only if only removed past appointments.
;;    e. Even when there are no messages, update the buffer.
;;    f. Fixed bug in calculation of appointment just before midnight.
;; 9. `appt-add':
;;    a. With prefix arg, also adds appointment to diary.
;;    b. New appointment must be later than now.
;;    c. Calls `appt-disp-window-function' when done.
;; 10. `appt-delete': Calls `appt-disp-window-function' when done.
;; 11. `appt-make-list':
;;    a. Add appointment help to mode line.
;;    b. Sort diary entries (via `sort-diary-entries').
;;    c. Remove past appointments from list.
;;    d. Display appointments.
;;
;;  The following bindings are made here for mode `reminders-mode':
;;
;;    `C-c C-s'        `save-reminders'
;;    `C-c d'          `clear-appointments'
;;    `C-c i a'        `appt-insert-anniversary-diary-entry'
;;    `C-c i c'        `appt-insert-cyclic-diary-entry'
;;    `C-c i d'        `appt-insert-diary-entry'
;;    `C-c i m'        `appt-insert-monthly-diary-entry'
;;    `C-c i w'        `appt-insert-weekly-diary-entry'
;;    `C-c i y'        `appt-insert-yearly-diary-entry'
;;    `C-c j'          `appt-add'
;;    `C-c k'          `appt-delete'
;;    `C-c s'          `show-all-diary-entries'
;;
;;  The following bindings are made here for mode `calendar-mode'.
;;  These commands are also added to the Diary menu bar menu.
;;
;;    `j'              `appt-add'
;;    `k'              `appt-delete'
;;    `r'              `appt-disp-window-function'
;;

; Revision 1.4  1995/08/11  08:17:04  dadams
; 1) Moved appt+.el code here (everything): show-reminders,
;    appt-delete-reminder, appt, and key binding for `t' in calendar-mode-map.
; 2) Require cl.el, drew-util-19.el, drew-misc-19.el.
; 3) Cleaned up code and comments.
; 4) appt-check: Fixed bug in calculation of appt just before midnight.
; 5) Renamings: appt-message-warning-time -> appt-msg-warning-time,
;    cur-comp-time -> cur-time, appt-comp-time -> appt-time.
;
; Revision 1.3  1995/08/11  06:27:20  dadams
; 1) appt-add, appt-delete: show-reminders at end.
; 2) appt-make-list: Put whole time-string, not appt-time-string, in
; time-msg.
;
; Revision 1.2  1995/08/04  14:45:42  dadams
; Require calendar.el.  Provide this.  Added header.

  "Major mode for appointment reminders buffer.

The following commands are available in this mode to control today's
appointment reminders:
\\<reminders-mode-map>
\t\\[appt-add]\tAdd an appointment for today.
\t\\[appt-delete]\tDelete some of today's appointments.
\t\\[save-reminders]\tTake into account changes made here to appointments.
\t\\[clear-appointments]\tClear all added appointments.  Display the diary,
\t\tand reinitialize today's appointments from the diary.

\(Bindings in Reminders mode are generally the same as those in
Calendar mode, prefixed by `C-c'.)

Today's appointments were initialized from today's diary entries.
See the doc for `diary-file' and `calendar-mode' for diary info.
Appointment reminders were generated from 1-line diary entries that
take this form:   

\[ DATE ]  MESSAGE-AND-TIME

The DATE is optional.  If present, it must not be preceded on the line
by anything (including whitespace).  If it is not present, and if the
line begins with whitespace (TAB, SPC), then the preceding DATE in the
diary file is used.  The DATE's syntax is as for a normal diary entry.

Aside from the DATE, the entire diary entry line, MESSAGE-AND-TIME, is
used as the appointment reminder message.

The appointment TIME is searched for within the MESSAGE-AND-TIME.  If
there is more than one TIME expression on the entry line, it is the
*last* one that is considered to represent the appointment time.  The
TIME can be expressed in either 24 hour or am/pm notation (e.g. \"13h35\"
or \"1:35pm\").

As an example, here are six appointment diary entries:

02/23/95 18:00 Dinner                                               (1)
Thursday
  10:00 Meeting                                                     (2)
  Lunch: 11:45am                                                    (3)
  3:00pm Meeting                                                    (4)
  Pick up kids at 18:00                                             (5)
31 Oct:  20h30 - Halloween party.  Leave for home early: 18h00.     (6)

Note that the last entry (6) will produce a reminder for 6pm, not for
8:30pm, since \"18h00\" is the last TIME on the line.

Once today's appointments have been generated from the diary, if you
want to make any changes to them you can just edit the list here (in
Reminders mode), then type `\\[save-reminders]' to take the changes into \
account.
Edited reminders here should take the same form as in the diary (see
above):  TIME  MESSAGE.  (The date is unnecessary.)

As an alternative to free editing of appointments here, you can use
`\\[appt-delete]' and `\\[appt-add]' to remove and add them.

Unlike the entries in your `diary-file', appointment reminders are
*volatile*:  They will disappear if you exit Emacs, for instance.
And they are automatically removed once their time has past.

Non-volatile appointment reminders may be created by first making the
appropriate diary entries, then executing `\\[clear-appointments]' (or \
`diary', or
`calendar', or `list-diary-entries').  However, this execution will
regenerate the (volatile) appointments list, causing appointments that
you may have already added (via `\\[appt-add]' and/or `\\[save-reminders]') \
to be lost.

It is possible to cause `\\[appt-add]' to add an appointment to your diary,
in addition to creating it as a volatile reminder, by giving `\\[appt-add]'
a prefix argument.  If the prefix is negative, the new diary entry is
non-marking; otherwise, it is marking.  Diary entries are of course
not deleted automatically, once their time is up, and `\\[appt-delete]' has no
effect on them.

In order to further facilitate access to your diary, the following
commands are also available in Reminders mode:

\t\\[show-all-diary-entries]\tEdit your diary. Show all entries, for all dates.
\t\\[appt-insert-diary-entry]\tInsert a diary entry for today.
\t\\[appt-insert-weekly-diary-entry]\tInsert a weekly diary entry for today.
\t\\[appt-insert-monthly-diary-entry]\tInsert a monthly diary entry for today.
\t\\[appt-insert-yearly-diary-entry]\tInsert a yearly diary entry for today.
\t\\[appt-insert-anniversary-diary-entry]\tInsert an anniversary diary entry \
for today.
\t\\[appt-insert-cyclic-diary-entry]\tInsert a cyclic diary entry, starting \
today.
\t\\[clear-appointments]\tRecreate today's diary entries from `diary-file'.
\t\tWARNING: This also clears today's appointments
\t\t(see above).
